# Future RSS Source Ideas

Sources to consider adding as the podcast evolves. These were researched but not yet implemented.

## 🤖 AI & Research

### Additional AI Companies
- **Meta AI Blog** — `https://ai.meta.com/blog/rss/`
  - Research from Meta's AI team (formerly FAIR)
  - Why wait: Already have good AI company coverage (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepMind, Microsoft)
  
- **Papers with Code** — `https://paperswithcode.com/latest`
  - Latest ML research papers with code implementations
  - Why wait: Very technical, may be too dense for daily podcast format

### AI Newsletters (Email-only, no RSS)
- **The Batch by Andrew Ng** — Weekly AI news, very accessible
- **Every.to (Chain of Thought)** — AI-focused business newsletter by Dan Shipper
- **Import AI by Jack Clark** — Weekly deep technical AI roundup

## 📰 Tech Journalism

### Consider If Want More Coverage
- **Wired** — `https://www.wired.com/feed/rss`
  - Tech + culture intersection
  - Why wait: The Verge already covers this territory
  
- **TechCrunch** — `https://techcrunch.com/feed/`
  - Startup/VC news
  - Why wait: Can be noisy, lots of funding announcements
  
- **The Information** — No RSS (paid newsletter)
  - Excellent in-depth tech journalism
  - Why wait: Requires paid subscription

### Analysis & Commentary
- **Stratechery by Ben Thompson** — No free RSS (paid)
  - Deep tech/business analysis
  - Why wait: Paid subscription required, posts are long

## 🧪 Science & Research

### Top-Tier Academic
- **Science Magazine News** — `https://www.science.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&feed=rss&jc=science`
  - Peer with Nature for prestige
  - Why wait: Already added Nature; these sources overlap significantly

### Science Communication
- **Our World in Data** — `https://ourworldindata.org/atom.xml`
  - Data-driven research on global challenges
  - Why wait: Great source but slower-moving; better for weekly than daily

## 💼 Business & Economics

- **The Economist (Technology section)** — Requires subscription
  - High-quality tech business coverage
  - Why wait: No free RSS, requires subscription

- **FiveThirtyEight** — `https://fivethirtyeight.com/feed/`
  - Data journalism (politics, sports, culture)
  - Why wait: May add too much non-tech content

- **Bloomberg Technology** — Limited RSS
  - Financial/tech intersection
  - Why wait: More suited to podcast format than RSS

## 🎙️ Podcast Transcripts to Consider

If you add functionality to parse podcast transcripts:
- **Hard Fork (NYT)** — Casey Newton & Kevin Roose on tech news
- **Decoder (The Verge)** — Nilay Patel interviews tech CEOs
- **Acquired** — Deep dives on company histories (long-form)
- **Lex Fridman** — Long-form AI/science interviews (3+ hours)

Why wait: Need to build transcript parsing functionality first

## 🌍 Global Tech Perspectives

- **Rest of World** — `https://restofworld.org/feed/latest/`
  - Tech news from non-Western perspectives
  - Why wait: Good source but may not align with current US/Europe-centric focus

## 🎨 Culture & Design

Already disabled in config, re-enable if desired:
- **Dezeen** — Architecture/design
- **Design Milk** — Product design
- **Core77** — Industrial design

## 📍 Local News

Already disabled in config, re-enable if desired:
- **Gothamist** — NYC local
- **NY1 Politics** — NYC politics

## 📊 When to Add More Sources

### Add if you notice:
- **Too much AI?** Add more space/science sources
- **Too technical?** Add more accessible journalism (Wired, TechCrunch)
- **Too US-centric?** Add Rest of World or international sources
- **Need more depth?** Add Papers with Code or academic journals
- **Want business angle?** Add The Economist or Bloomberg

### Test with Current Setup First
Run 5-10 episodes with current config before adding more. Key questions:
1. Is there enough content diversity?
2. Are you learning something new each day?
3. Is the tone right (informed but not dry)?
4. Any sources consistently boring or consistently great?

### Source Balance Guidelines
- **AI sources:** 5-7 (currently: 7) ✅
- **General tech:** 3-5 (currently: 4) ✅
- **Space/science:** 3-5 (currently: 5) ✅
- **Positive/constructive:** 1-2 (currently: 1) ✅
- **Personal interest:** 0-3 (currently: 0, disabled)

## 🎯 Implementation Priority

**If adding one source next, choose:**
1. **Our World in Data** — Data-driven, credible, broad appeal
2. **Wired** — Accessible tech journalism, culture angle
3. **Meta AI Blog** — Round out AI company coverage

**If cutting one source to make room:**
1. Consider reducing Hacker News (most unpredictable quality)
2. Consider reducing The Verge (if too much culture, not enough tech)
3. Check Space.com vs NASA overlap

## 📝 Notes

- Most recommendations assume you want to stay focused on tech/science/AI
- "Every.to" doesn't have RSS; best consumed via email newsletter
- Several top sources (Stratechery, The Information) require paid subscriptions
- Nature and Science overlap significantly; having both may be redundant
